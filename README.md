# Delineating Global Tree Functional Regions: A Trait-Based Approach
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the project Delineating Global Tree Functional Regions: A Trait-Based Approach. The project aims to create a comprehensive functional regionalization of global forests by analyzing 18 key functional traits.
## Getting Started
###  Prerequisites
To run the analysis, you will need to have the following software installed:

Julia (for functional distance calculation)
R (for clustering analysis and figure generation)

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the data directory. It includes all the necessary information for running the analysis, such as trait data and species distribution

# # # Running the Analysis
Functional Distance Calculation (Julia)
Navigate to the functional_distance directory.
Run the Julia script to calculate the functional distances.


# # # Clustering and Visualization (R)
Navigate to the clustering_and_visualization directory.
Run the R script to perform clustering and generate figures.
