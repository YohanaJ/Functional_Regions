Delineating Global Tree Functional Regions: A Trait-Based Approach
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the project Delineating Global Tree Functional Regions: A Trait-Based Approach. The project aims to create a comprehensive functional regionalization of global forests by analyzing 18 key functional traits.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the analysis, you will need to have the following software installed:

Julia (for functional distance calculation)
R (for clustering analysis and figure generation)

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the data directory. It includes all the necessary information for running the analysis, such as trait data and species distribution

Running the Analysis
Functional Distance Calculation (Julia)
Navigate to the functional_distance directory.
Run the Julia script to calculate the functional distances.


Clustering and Visualization (R)
Navigate to the clustering_and_visualization directory.
Run the R script to perform clustering and generate figures.
